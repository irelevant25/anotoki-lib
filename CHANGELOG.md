# Changelog

One version for both halves: the Composer package `anotoki/lib` (from the git tag)
and the npm package `@anotoki/lib` (`angular/projects/lib/package.json`). While the
version is 0.x, a minor version may break what a site uses - each such change is
said here, with what a site must do.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-07

The first version: the migrations module, one behaviour for every site while its
database waits for an update (the owner's request of 2026-10-07).

PHP (`Anotoki\Lib\Migrations`):
- `Migrator` - reads, applies and records the files of one or more `MigrationSet`s,
  in every shape the sites' `migrations` tables have, never changing one; each file
  whole or not at all, stopping at the first failure; one apply at a time (an
  advisory lock, `busy` otherwise); drafts (`ready`), and the hooks `prepare`,
  `beforeFile`, `beforeApply`; `split: false` for a file sent in one `exec`.
- `Splitter` - a file's statements.
- `Http\SiteState`, `Http\SiteGate` (PSR-15) and `Http\MigrationsRoutes` - the
  states `not_set_up`, `update_pending`, `unavailable`, `ready`; the 503 answers
  (the setup page only while never installed; `Retry-After: 60` while an update
  waits); the public status route and the admin migrations routes.

Angular (`@anotoki/lib/migrations`):
- `SiteStatus`, `siteStatusInterceptor`, `provideAnotokiMigrations`.
- `<anotoki-site-gate>`, `<anotoki-site-status>` (words in English and Slovak,
  overridable), `<anotoki-update-banner>`, `<anotoki-migrations-page>`.
- `ANOTOKI_LIB_VERSION` from `@anotoki/lib`.
