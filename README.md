# anotoki-lib

What the anotoki sites share - the IAM, genshin, the survey site, Piano Academy,
Japanese Academy and the build analyzer - in one library with two halves and one
version:

| Half | Package | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PHP 8.2+, Slim 4, PostgreSQL | `anotoki/lib` (Composer) | `composer.json`, `php/src/`, `php/migrations/`, `php/resources/` |
| Angular 21 (standalone, zoneless, signals) | `@anotoki/lib` (npm tarball) | `angular/projects/lib/` |

Version 0.1.1 holds one module: **migrations** - the engine that brings a
site's database up to date, and one behaviour for every site while an update
waits. Unreleased (0.3.0, CHANGELOG.md): the engine's **library sets** - the
library's own migration files beside a site's - and the PHP half of
**translations** (the section "Translations" below).

## The behaviour

The server decides a state for every request:

| state | when |
| --- | --- |
| `not_set_up` | the site's settings files are missing or invalid |
| `update_pending` | the settings are fine and at least one migration file is ready to apply |
| `unavailable` | the settings are fine but the database cannot be reached |
| `ready` | otherwise |

- `not_set_up`: every API path answers `503 {"code":"not_set_up","installed":…,"message":…}`,
  with `"setup":"/setup.php"` only while the site was never installed
  (`storage/installed.lock`, which a site's installer writes on a real host).
- `update_pending` (every site but the IAM blocks): every API path answers
  `503 {"code":"update_pending","message":"The site is being updated. Try again in a few minutes."}`
  with `Retry-After: 60` - except the site's open paths: its boot/sign-in
  configuration, its translations, its health check, the status path and the
  admin migrations routes. So people can sign in, the pages have their words,
  and an administrator reaches Apply.
- What people see:
  - visitors and signed-in people who are not the site's ADMIN: "The site is
    being updated", in their language, checking again by itself and reloading
    when the site is back; no error, no code, no button but a quiet "Sign in"
    while nobody is signed in (how an administrator gets in);
  - the site's ADMIN: "A database update is waiting" and "Open Migrations"; the
    Migrations page works, nothing else does;
  - never set up: "This site is not set up yet" and "Open the setup page";
  - set up once but not answering, or unavailable: "The site is not available
    right now", checking again by itself - never the setup page.
- The IAM keeps answering while an update waits (`blockWhilePending: false`);
  its admin panel shows its administrators one line, "A database update is
  waiting", linking to Migrations.

## Installing it in a site

PHP - in `backend/composer.json`:

```json
"repositories": [{ "type": "vcs", "url": "https://github.com/irelevant25/anotoki-lib" }],
"require": { "anotoki/lib": "^0.1" }
```

then `php composer.phar update anotoki/lib --prefer-dist` in `backend/`. Composer
takes the version from the git tag and installs GitHub's archive of it, which
holds the PHP half only - its code (`php/src`), the migration files of the
library's sets (`php/migrations`) and its resources (`php/resources`), with
`composer.json`, this README and CHANGELOG.md: `.gitattributes` is an
allow-list, and CI builds the archive and checks it
(`.github/scripts/check-archive.sh`). Where the site uploads `vendor/`,
`vendor/anotoki/lib` goes with it - kept from being served as the site's own
`migrations/` is (a deny-all `.htaccess`), since it holds SQL too.

Angular - in `frontend/package.json`:

```json
"@anotoki/lib": "https://github.com/irelevant25/anotoki-lib/releases/download/v0.1.1/anotoki-lib-0.1.1.tgz"
```

then `bun install` in `frontend/` (and `npm install` too where the site keeps a
`package-lock.json`, so both lock files agree). Peer dependencies:
`@angular/core`, `@angular/common`, `@angular/router` ^21.2 and `rxjs` ^7.8.

**Updating** to a new version: PHP - change the constraint where the new
version needs it (0.x: a minor version may break - read CHANGELOG.md), then the
same `composer update anotoki/lib --prefer-dist`; Angular - the new release's URL
in `package.json`, then `bun install`. Update both halves together.

## The PHP half

```php
use Anotoki\Lib\Migrations\Http\MigrationsRoutes;
use Anotoki\Lib\Migrations\Http\SiteGate;
use Anotoki\Lib\Migrations\Http\SiteState;
use Anotoki\Lib\Migrations\MigrationSet;
use Anotoki\Lib\Migrations\Migrator;

$migrator = fn (): Migrator => new Migrator(db(), [new MigrationSet('survey', __DIR__ . '/../migrations/survey')]);

$state = new SiteState(
    settingsProblem: fn (): ?string => settingsProblem(),          // null once config/*.local.php are complete
    installed: fn (): bool => is_file(storageDir() . '/installed.lock'),
    migrator: $migrator,                                            // only called once the settings are complete
    // blockWhilePending: false,                                    // the IAM: keep answering while an update waits
);

$app->add(new SiteGate($state, $app->getResponseFactory(), [
    '/api/auth/config',                     // exact paths...
    '~^/api/translations/[a-z-]+$~D',       // ...or a regular expression when it starts with '~' (end it with D)
    '/api/health',
    '~^/api/admin/migrations(/file|/apply)?$~D', // exactly the three routes - never a prefix
]));

MigrationsRoutes::status($app, $state);                            // GET /api/site-status
MigrationsRoutes::admin($app, '/api/admin/migrations', $migrator, function ($request, array $result): void {
    // after every Apply that was not busy: audit, clear caches
})->add($requireAdmin);                                             // the site's ADMIN check (from the token)
```

- `Migrator` - `files($set)`, `status()` and `applicable()` (read only: they never
  create anything), `apply()`, `source($set, $name)`, `ensureTable()`. Each file
  runs in a transaction of its own with its record; the run stops at the first
  file that fails (rolled back whole; later sets never run), and the result
  names it with the database's error: `statement N of M: <message>` and the
  statement's first six lines. One apply at a time: every apply takes
  `pg_try_advisory_lock` (`DEFAULT_LOCK`, or the site's `lock`) and answers
  `busy` when another holds it. The connection is used as given and needs
  `PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION`.
- Options: `table` (`migrations`), `lock`, `split` (false sends a file in one
  `exec`), and hooks: `ready(set, name, sql)` (false: a draft - it and every file
  after it wait; drafts never stop the site), `prepare(pdo)` (write paths only,
  before the table is created or used: adopt an older shape there),
  `beforeFile(pdo, set, name)` (inside the file's transaction),
  `beforeApply(pdo, files)` (once; its string is the result's `note`; throwing
  ends the apply with nothing applied).
- The bookkeeping table is read and written in every shape the sites have, and
  never changed: the file in `filename` (or `name`), the set in `folder` where
  the table has one (required with more than one set of the site's own),
  `applied_at` a TIMESTAMP holding UTC or a TIMESTAMPTZ (answered as ISO 8601
  UTC, `…Z`). A missing table is created as `(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, filename
  VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, UNIQUE
  (filename))`, with `folder VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE (folder,
  filename)` for more than one set of the site's own. A table it cannot read (no
  file column) counts as nothing applied until `prepare` adopts it.
- **Library sets** (unreleased, 0.3.0): `MigrationSet::library($name, $dir)` is a
  set the library ships - `Translations\Schema::migrationSet()` is one - and the
  names that begin with `anotoki_` are theirs alone (a site's set named so is
  refused). A site lists them with its own, in the order they run:
  `[new MigrationSet('iam', …), Schema::migrationSet()]`. In a table without
  `folder` a library set's file is recorded as `<set>/<file>`
  (`anotoki_translations/001_languages_and_strings.sql`), wherever the set stands
  in the list; in one with `folder` (genshin) as `folder = <set>`. The site's own
  sets are recorded as before - the first by its file names alone - so adding a
  library set changes nothing in a site's table, a new table still has the shape
  the site's own sets need, and a build without the library set still reads
  every record of the site's own (it lists the library's as missing). A record
  of a set that is not configured is listed as missing under that set's name.
  `ready`, `beforeFile` and `beforeApply` see the library's files with their set
  (`$set->library` is true); a draft holds every file after it, the library's
  too; all of it under the site's one advisory lock.
- `Splitter::split($sql)` - the statements of a file: a `;` ends one only outside
  comments, strings (`'…'`, `E'…'`), quoted names and dollar-quoted blocks.
- `MigrationsRoutes::admin` answers `GET $base` (`Migrator::status()`),
  `GET $base/file?set=&name=` (the SQL, or 404) and `POST $base/apply` (200 with
  `applied`, `failed`, `error`, `note` - a failed file is still a 200 - or 409
  `busy`). The site's admin check must not need tables a pending migration makes.

## The Angular half - `@anotoki/lib/migrations`

```ts
// app.config.ts
provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([siteStatusInterceptor /* , the site's own */])),
provideAnotokiMigrations(() => {
  const auth = inject(AuthService);                 // the factory runs in an injection context
  const i18n = inject(TranslationService);
  return {
    statusUrl: '/api/site-status',
    apiBase: '/api/admin/migrations',
    migrationsRoute: '/admin/migrations',           // the site's route showing <anotoki-migrations-page>
    isAdmin: () => auth.roles().includes('ADMIN'),  // ADMIN of this site, from the token (signals work)
    isSignedIn: () => auth.signedIn(),
    signIn: () => auth.signIn(),                    // returning to the current page
    language: () => i18n.language(),                // 'en' and 'sk' built in; others read English
    formatDate: (iso) => i18n.formatDate(iso),      // optional: default en-GB, '6 Oct 2026, 10:01'
    onUpToDate: () => i18n.reload(),                // optional: after an Apply leaves nothing to apply
    // setupUrl: '/setup.php', retrySeconds: 30, words: { sk: { updatingTitle: '…' } }
  };
}),
provideAppInitializer(() => inject(SiteStatus).check()),   // early in the boot; the boot must not stop on update_pending
```

```html
<!-- the app's template: the gate around the router outlet, and around nothing else; the
     template makes the pages only while the site is open (0.1.1) -->
<anotoki-site-gate><ng-template><router-outlet /></ng-template></anotoki-site-gate>
```

- `SiteStatus` - `state` (`'unknown' | 'ready' | 'update-pending' | 'not-set-up' |
  'unavailable'`), `installed`, `blocked`, `check()`, `report(code, installed?)`,
  `markReady()`.
- `siteStatusInterceptor` - a 503 whose body's `code` is `update_pending` or
  `not_set_up` tells `SiteStatus` (the request still fails).
- `<anotoki-site-gate>` - its content while the site is ready (or not asked
  yet), or for the ADMIN on the Migrations route while an update waits;
  `<anotoki-site-status>` otherwise. Give it the pages as an `<ng-template>`:
  then they are made only while they show (content given as it is is made
  anyway, and a page behind the status page would run and send requests).
- `<anotoki-site-status>` - the page of the section above.
- `<anotoki-update-banner>` - the IAM's one line for its administrators.
- `<anotoki-migrations-page>` - the admin page (English; for the site's ADMIN
  only): Pending (with drafts), Applied (with each file's SQL), Missing, and
  "Apply pending".

A site that does not block while an update waits (the IAM, `blockWhilePending:
false`) puts **no** gate around its outlet and does not ask at boot: the status
path does say `update_pending` there, and the gate would close the site to
everybody. It uses the interceptor, `<anotoki-update-banner>` in its admin panel
(which asks the server itself once an ADMIN is there), the Migrations page, and
`<anotoki-site-status>` where it shows its "not set up" page.

Theming: the components use these custom properties, each with a readable
fallback built on `light-dark()`; a site maps its own tokens onto them, for
light and dark: `--anotoki-bg`, `--anotoki-surface`, `--anotoki-text`,
`--anotoki-muted`, `--anotoki-border`, `--anotoki-primary`,
`--anotoki-primary-contrast`, `--anotoki-danger`, `--anotoki-danger-contrast`,
`--anotoki-success`, `--anotoki-warning`, `--anotoki-radius`,
`--anotoki-font-mono`.

## Translations (unreleased, 0.3.0: the PHP half)

Every site keeps its words in three tables - `languages`, `translation_keys`,
`translations` - which the IAM wrote first and the survey, Piano Academy,
Japanese Academy and the build analyzer copied. `Anotoki\Lib\Translations` is
one implementation of them for every site: the schema, the bundle the pages
read, the admin pages' API, the checks of a string, the command line. One wire
format, the IAM's (snake_case; anotoki-iam's `docs/api.md` is the contract, and
the bundle is the IAM's byte for byte). The library decides nobody's
permissions: each route group takes the site's own checks. The Angular half
(`@anotoki/lib/translations`) comes later.

### The schema: the library's set `anotoki_translations`

```php
$migrator = new Migrator($pdo, [new MigrationSet('survey', __DIR__ . '/../migrations/survey'), Schema::migrationSet()], $options);
```

- The set comes **after** the site's own: the sites' early migrations made these
  tables themselves (Japanese Academy's with a plain `CREATE TABLE`). A site born
  without them may list it first.
- `001_languages_and_strings.sql` makes the tables only where they are missing
  (named constraints, `updated_by` an id without a foreign key), with English
  and Slovak, and proves the shape the library relies on where they are there:
  the columns of compatible types, the three primary keys, the two foreign keys
  of `translations` cascading on update and delete, the `CHECK (value <> '')`,
  no column of the site's own that must be filled and has no default, English
  switched on. It refuses any other shape, naming every difference (genshin's
  today: `languages` keyed by name, TIMESTAMP stamps, no CHECK) - such a site
  moves its tables into the one shape in a migration of its own first. It
  tolerates each site's own: `updated_by` INT or BIGINT and a foreign key from
  it to the site's people, other tables referring to `languages (code)`,
  constraint names, columns of its own with a default. On the five aligned
  sites it makes nothing.
- `002_library_words.sql` adds the library's keys, under `anotoki.` (the
  language switcher's and the status page's words). Their descriptions are the
  library's; their strings are written only for a library key that has none, so
  a site that took a key over - its own words, a language left blank on purpose -
  keeps them, and so does an owner's rewording.
- The house rules: every library file ends with `-- end of NNN` (Japanese
  Academy's draft rule accepts it), has LF line endings, one string a line with
  `''` for an apostrophe and nothing else escaped, names no site table, runs
  whole or statement by statement (`split`), and is never edited once released.
  A site migration never depends on a library file and writes only the base
  columns; a site's gate never counts keys outside its own namespaces (`WHERE
  name NOT LIKE 'anotoki.%'`); `anotoki.` is the library's namespace; a site that
  words a library string its own way writes the key first (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT
  DO NOTHING`, then `UPDATE … WHERE value = '<the library's words>'` for a
  database that has the library's already).

### The PHP half

```php
use Anotoki\Lib\Translations\Http\TranslationsRoutes;
use Anotoki\Lib\Translations\Rules\RequiredPlaceholders;
use Anotoki\Lib\Translations\Translations;
use Anotoki\Lib\Translations\TranslationsConfig;

$translations = fn (): Translations => new Translations(db(), new TranslationsConfig(
    releasedLanguages: ['en', 'sk'],                    // the migrations write strings for them: never deleted
    // serverNamespaces: ['mail'],                      // the IAM: never in a bundle; whole in the audit summary
    // rules: [new RequiredPlaceholders(['login.continueTo' => ['app']]), $iamMailRules],
    // usage: $languageUsage,                           // the site's fields, refusal and work around a delete
    // extraCheck: fn (string $field, string $text, array $about): ?Refusal => …,
    // beforeWrite: fn (PDO $pdo, ?int $userId) => …,   // inside a save's transaction, first
));

TranslationsRoutes::bundle($app, $translations, $error);                            // GET /api/translations/{code}
TranslationsRoutes::strings($app, '/api/admin', $translations, $actor, $error, $audit)->add($requireEditor);
TranslationsRoutes::languages($app, '/api/admin', $translations, $error, $audit)->add($requireAdmin);
// and in the gate's open paths: TranslationsRoutes::openPath() - '~^/api/translations/[^/]+$~D'
```

- `Translations` (built per request from a connection with
  `PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION`, as the Migrator is) - `ready()`, `offeredCodes()`,
  `bundle($code)` (`{language, languages, values, english?}`: the language's
  strings over English, no key of a server namespace, `sk-sk` answered by `sk`;
  503 `translations_unavailable` without the tables or an English string),
  `languages()` (`{code, name, native_name, enabled, sort_order, seeded,
  strings}` and the site's fields), `createLanguage()` (under `LOCK TABLE …
  SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE`, last in the order, at most `languagesMax`),
  `updateLanguage()` (what is sent; `changed` for the audit; English stays on),
  `deleteLanguage()` (never English, never a released language; the row held
  `FOR UPDATE`; its strings cascade), `grid()`, `save($values, $userId)` (one
  transaction; a string sent as it is keeps its writer and time; a blank one in
  another language goes; the IAM's audit summary), `export()`, `import()` (a flat
  `{key: text}`; a blank is passed over, an unknown key refused),
  `forgetWriter($id)`, `storedRefusals()`, `keyNames()`, `keysWithout($code)`.
  None of them throws for a refusal: they answer a `Support\Refusal` (status,
  code, message, extra).
- `StringCheck::changes()` - the IAM's checks in the IAM's order, the changes
  sorted by key and language (one lock order for every save): `invalid_value`,
  `unknown_key` (+ `keys`), `unknown_language`, `fallback_required`,
  `invalid_placeholder`, `placeholder_changed`, `unknown_placeholder`, and what a
  site's rules add. Text is measured as the browser does (`Text`: its `trim()`
  set, blank when nothing is to be seen, code points); a run of a million spaces
  is too long, never empty.
- `KeyRules` - a site's rules for some of its keys: `placeholders($key)` (the
  key's fixed placeholders, in every language), `checkFirst()` (before the
  family's length and brace checks: a mail string's one line, its length and
  bytes) and `check()` (after them: a placeholder a key must keep, an address in
  a mail). The IAM's mail rules become one of these, in the IAM;
  `Rules\RequiredPlaceholders` and `Rules\LibraryKeyRules` (an `anotoki.*` key
  has the library's placeholders, whatever a site's stored English says) ship.
- `LanguageUsage` - `extras()` (the IAM's `accounts`), `refuseDelete()` (the
  survey's 409 `language_in_use`), `beforeDelete()` (Japanese Academy's copy of
  the strings; throwing cancels the delete).
- `TranslationsRoutes` - `bundle()` (public, reads no token and no cookie; `ETag`
  and `Cache-Control: no-cache`, 304 compared the weak way, `-gzip`/`-br`/`-zstd`
  tags too; a database that cannot be asked is a 503 as well), `strings()`
  (`GET $base/languages`, `GET|PUT $base/translations`,
  `GET $base/translations/{code}/export` - a download in the file's format -,
  `PUT $base/translations/{code}/import`) and `languages()` (`POST
  $base/languages`, `PUT|DELETE $base/languages/{code}` - the delete answers
  `{strings, …the site's fields}`). In order: a `{code}` that is none, 404 before
  any query; the body - read by the library from the raw stream, JSON only (415),
  at most `bodyLimit` (413), not empty (422 `empty_body`), JSON (400
  `invalid_json`), `{}` kept apart from `[]`; then 503 `translations_unavailable`
  with `Retry-After: 60` while the tables are missing; then the work. JSON
  answers carry `Cache-Control: no-store`. `$error(ResponseInterface, Refusal)`
  is the site's error body (the IAM's `{error, code, …extra}`; by default
  `{code, message, …extra}`), `$actor(request)` the writer's id (from the session
  or the token, never a body), `$audit(request, action, type, id, details)` the
  site's log: `language.created|updated|deleted`, `translations.saved|imported`.
- The command line - `Cli\TranslationsCommand` wrapped by a site's short
  `translations.php` (never uploaded): `--status` (missing keys, keys without
  English and the scan's problems fail; unused keys and stored strings a save
  would refuse warn; each language's coverage), `--export CODE [FILE]`,
  `--import CODE FILE` (written by nobody, audited `via: command line`); it
  refuses while the tables are missing or a migration waits.
  `Cli\KeyScanner($root, exclude, dynamicKeys, ignoreNamespaces, pipes, calls,
  pluralForms, innerHtml)` is the family's scan of a frontend (the IAM: pipe `t`,
  no plural forms, `innerHtml: 'anywhere'`, `mail` ignored; `anotoki` always
  ignored). `Cli\EnglishDictionary` reads a site's compiled English (a
  TypeScript object or JSON parts) to hold it to the seeded English.

### The library's own words

`php/resources/library-words.json`, `{"keys": {name: {description, en, sk}}}`,
is the one source of the `anotoki.*` keys: `LibraryWords` reads it (and
`LibraryKeyRules` takes the placeholders from it), and a test holds what the
library's migrations write on a new database to it. A new library string is an
entry there and a new library migration; a rewording of a released one is a
migration that changes it only where it still has the earlier words. The
Angular half is to read the same file and never keep a copy by hand: a script
(`angular/scripts/library-words.mjs`) generates its built-in words
(`translations/src/library-words.ts`, committed), and a spec fails when that file
is stale - so a page has the library's words while the database cannot be
reached, and never shows a library key as a key.

## Working on the library

```
# PHP (from the repository root; on this family's Windows machines `php8`)
php composer.phar install
ANOTOKI_LIB_TEST_DB_CONFIG=../anotoki-iam/backend/config/database.local.php vendor/bin/phpunit
#   or ANOTOKI_LIB_TEST_PGHOST / _PGPORT / _PGUSER / _PGPASSWORD; the user needs CREATEDB:
#   each test case makes a database anotoki_lib_test_<random> and drops it

# Angular (from angular/)
bun install
bun run build        # ng build lib -> angular/dist/lib
bun run test         # ng test lib --watch=false (Vitest, jsdom)
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the PHP tests on 8.2 and 8.4 against
PostgreSQL 16, builds the Composer archive and checks what it holds
(`sh .github/scripts/check-archive.sh` does the same locally), and builds and
tests the Angular library.

## Releasing

1. Bump the version in `angular/projects/lib/package.json` and
   `ANOTOKI_LIB_VERSION` (`angular/projects/lib/src/public-api.ts`; a test keeps
   them equal), and add it to `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Commit, `git tag vX.Y.Z`, push the commit and the tag.
3. The release workflow builds and tests the library, refuses a tag that is not
   `v` + that version, packs it and attaches `anotoki-lib-X.Y.Z.tgz` to a GitHub
   Release of the tag.
4. Each site updates its constraint (`composer.json`) and the tarball's URL
   (`package.json`).
